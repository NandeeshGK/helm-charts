> NOTE: It is highly recommended that you create a backup of the cluster before running the upgrade process. Check out [this guide](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/backup-restore-bitnami-deployments-velero/) to learn how to backup and restore Bitnami Helm chart deployments using [Velero](https://velero.io/).

* Select the cluster to upgrade. If a new version of the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid is available, the "Upgrade" button will be active. Click it to start the upgrade process.
