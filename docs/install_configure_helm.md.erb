The easiest way to run and manage applications in a Kubernetes cluster is using Helm. Helm allows you to perform key operations for managing applications such as install, upgrade or delete.

* To install Helm v3.x, run the following commands:

        $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 > get_helm.sh
        $ chmod 700 get_helm.sh
        $ ./get_helm.sh

    > TIP: If you are using OS X you can install it with the *brew install* command: *brew install helm*.

Once you have installed Helm, a set of useful commands to perform common actions is shown below:
