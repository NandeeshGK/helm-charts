* Install Velero on the source and destination clusters.
* Use Velero to back up the PersistentVolumes (PVs) used by the deployment on the source cluster.
* Use Velero to restore the backed-up PVs on the destination cluster.
* Create a new deployment on the destination cluster with the same chart, deployment name, credentials and other parameters as the original. This new deployment will use the restored PVs and hence the original data.
