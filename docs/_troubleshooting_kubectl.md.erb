### Detect issues

There are two common scenarios due to errors when running *kubectl*:

* Error 1: *kubectl* does not permit access to certain resources. This occurs when you run the  *kubectl* command and see the following error:

        the server does not allow access to the requested resource

* Error 2: *kubectl* is not able to find your nodes. This occurs when you run the *kubectl get nodes* command and see the following error:

        the server doesn't have a resource type "nodes"

### Solve issues

#### Error 1: *kubectl* does not permit access to certain resources

You probably are experiencing issues with the Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. This typically occurs when RBAC is enabled, which is the default situation from Kubernetes 1.6 onwards. 

To resolve this issue, you must create and deploy the necessary RBAC policies for users and resources. [Read our RBAC guide for more information and examples](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/configure-rbac-in-your-kubernetes-cluster/).

#### Error 2: *kubectl* is not able to find your nodes

This occurs because the authentication credentials are not correctly set. 

To resolve this, copy the configuration file */etc/kubernetes/admin.conf* to *~/.kube/config* in a regular user account (with *sudo* if necessary) and try again. 

> IMPORTANT: This command should not be performed in the *root* user account.

     $ cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ~/.kube/config
