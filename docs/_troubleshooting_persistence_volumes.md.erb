### Detect issues

To check if the status of your persistence volumes, run the *kubectl get pvc* command. If the output message shows that your PVC status is *pending* and you are using a Bitnami Helm chart, this may be because your cluster does not support dynamic provisioning (such as a bare metal cluster). In this case, the pod is unable to start because the cluster is unable to fulfil the request for a persistent volume and attach it to the container.

### Solve issues

To fix this, you must manually configure some persistent volumes or set up a *StorageClass* resource and provisioner for dynamic volume provisioning, such as the [NFS provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/nfs). [Learn more about dynamic provisioning and storage classes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/03/dynamic-provisioning-and-storage-classes-kubernetes/).
