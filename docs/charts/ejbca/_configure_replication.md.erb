By default, this chart only deploys a single pod running EJBCA. To increase the number of replicas, follow the steps below:

1. Create a conventional release with only one replica. This will be scaled later.
2. Wait for the release to complete and for EJBCA to be running. Verify access to the main page of the application.
3. Perform an upgrade specifying the number of replicas and the credentials that were previously used. Set the parameters *replicaCount*, *ejbcaAdminPassword* and *mariadb.auth.password* accordingly.

For example, for a release using *secretPassword* and *dbPassword* to scale up to a total of 2 replicas, the parameters used should be *replicaCount=2*, *ejbcaAdminPassword=secretPassword*, *mariadb.auth.password=dbPassword*.
