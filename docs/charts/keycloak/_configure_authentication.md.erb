Keycloak can be easily configured as an authentication service provider for other applications. It supports many popular protocols (such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, LDAP and SAML 2.0) and social networks (such as Google, Twitter and Facebook). Keycloak also provides integration libraries for common programming languages and server applications, including Java, Node.js, Apache, Tomcat and Wildfly.

To use Keycloak as an authentication service provider, it is necessary to configure a Keycloak realm, user and client. Our [tutorial on adding user authentication to applications with a scalable Keycloak deployment on Kubernetes](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/integrate-keycloak-authentication-kubernetes) walks you through the entire process.
