It is possible to deploy the Wavefront Collector as a Daemonset or a Deployment.

When used as Deployment:
* A single Wavefront Collector pod will be deployed in the cluster. Kubernetes will schedule the pod on any available node with enough resources.
* If you add a node to the cluster, the deployment will not automatically spawn a pod on that node.

When used as Daemonset:
* Kubernetes will attempt to adhere to a one-pod-per-node model.
* There will not be more than one replica per node.
* If you add a node to the cluster, the DaemonSet will automatically spawn a pod on that node

The most common use case is to deploy the Wavefront Collector as a DaemonSet to obtain information from the different nodes. However, there are some use cases where a Deployment can be used to gather data (at application level) without deploying a pod per node.
