By default, this Helm chart provides a basic configuration for Logstash: listening to HTTP requests on port 8080 and writing them to the standard output.

This Logstash configuration can be adjusted through the use of custom configuration files. Specify the Logstash configuration using the *input*, *filter*, and *output* parameters, which allow specification of the input, filter and output plugins configuration respectively.

In addition to these options, the chart also supports reading configuration from an external ConfigMap containing the configuration files. This is done via the *existingConfiguration* parameter. Note that this will override the parameters discussed in the previous paragraph.
